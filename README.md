# resume

Personal resume created with LaTeX. Original template source: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/cs-slash-it-slash-swe-resume-template/ncxgzcgknkmf
I recommend Overleaf as an easy to use platform for editing and compiling LaTeX into a PDF. Simply create a project, add in my resume.tex file, and compile!
